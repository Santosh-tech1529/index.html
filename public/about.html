<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Santosh, and I hold a Diploma in Computer Science, which I completed in 2012. I began my career as a Process Executive at Accenture in Mumbai, where I gained foundational experience in
managing processes and delivering quality results. This role helped me develop key professional
skills and adapt to a fast-paced work environment.</p>

<p>After Accenture, I joined Inspro IT Company, where I further honed my expertise in process
management and IT operations. This experience allowed me to take on new challenges and expand
my understanding of the industry.</p>

<p>Currently, I am working as a Senior Process Executive at Qicpic Innovation Pvt. Ltd. In this role, I am 
responsible for driving process improvements and ensuring operational efficiency. At the same time, 
I am actively learning JavaScript with the goal of becoming a software developer. I am passionate 
about building my technical skills and transitioning into a development-focused role to contribute to 
innovative projects.</p>
